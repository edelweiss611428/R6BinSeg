# R6BinSeg
Object-Oriented Binary Segmentation with a Polymorphic Cost Interface  
  
*(Project currently in progress)*

## Overview

`R6BinSeg` is a demonstration R package illustrating how to implement
Binary Segmentation (BinSeg) using a clean object-oriented architecture
based on:

- Modern C++ cost objects (via Rcpp/RcppArmadillo)
- A high-level R6 interface for segmentation workflows
- A single abstract cost interface shared by both C++ and R-defined costs

The package is intended solely for educational and presentation purposes.
It prioritises clarity of design over performance, completeness, or API
stability.
